# Housing-Prices-in-California-Machine-Learning-Prediction
This repository explores how we can predict the prices of houses in California using various features such as the number of bedrooms, median income of families living in the block, etc. The data used to create these models was dervied from the 1990 California census, meaning that it should not be used to make predictions about current house prices. These models are meant to be a simple exercise showing how various regression supervised learning models can be applied to these types of problems.
